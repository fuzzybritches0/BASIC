different BASIC programmes I did as a child

I learned programming on an 8086 computer with an orange monochrome monitor and GwBASIC. (I'm not that old - my school could'nt afford new computers in the 1990s - well, I guess I'm old). Later on I used QuickBASIC to write my programmes. This is only a small selection of the progammes I made. One important programme is missing: my diary manager of which I lost the source code due to data loss.
